#
# This module is responsible for the following:
# 1. determining which legs of the hexapod is on the ground
# 2. Computing the normal vector of the triangle defined by at least three legs on the ground
# the normal vector wrt to the old normal vector that is defined by the legs on the ground in
# the hexapod's neutral position
# 3. Determining the height of the center of gravity wrt to the ground
