"""
❗❗❗A more general algorithm for computing the robot's orientation.
This algorithm rests upon the assumption that it
knows which point of the each leg is in contact with the ground.
This assumption seems to be true for all possible cases for
leg-patterns page and inverse-kinematics page.

But this is not true for all possible
angle combinations (18 angles) that can be defined in
the kinematics page.

This module is used for the leg-patterns page,
and the inverse-kinematics page.

The other module will be used for the kinematics page.
❗❗❗

This module is responsible for the following:
1. determining which legs of the hexapod is on the ground
2. Computing the normal vector of the triangle defined by at least three legs on the ground
the normal vector wrt to the old normal vector that is defined by the legs on the ground in
the hexapod's neutral position
3. Determining the height of the center of gravity (cog) wrt to the ground.
ie this height is distance between the cog and the plane defined by ground contacts.
