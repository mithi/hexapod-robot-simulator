# 🕷️ Mithi's Hexapod Robot Simulator 💕
- A simple browser-based hexapod robot simulator built from first principles 🕷️
- If you like this project, consider [buying me a few ☕ cups of coffee](https://ko-fi.com/minimithi).

| Feature   | Description  |
|-----------|--------------|
| 💕 Forward Kinematics | Given angles of each joint, what does the robot look like?|
| 💕 Inverse Kinematics | What are the angles of each joint to make the robot look the way I want? Is it even possible? Why or why not? |
| 💕 Uniform Movements | If all of the legs behaved the same way, what will the robot look like? |
| 💕 Customizability | Set the dimensions and shape of the robot's body and legs. (6 parameters) |
| 💕 Usability | Control the camera view, pan, tilt, zoom, whatever. |
| 💕 Simplicity | Minimal dependencies. Depends solely on Numpy for calculations. Uses only Plotly-dash for plotting, Dash can be safely replaced if a better 3d plotting library is available. |
| ❗ Stability Check (WIP) | If we pose the robot in a particular way, will it fall over? |
| ❗ Fast | Okay, it's not as fast as I wanted, but on a local server, it's okay |
| ❗ Bug-free | Fine, right now there's still room for improvement |
| ❗ Well-tested | Yeah, I need to compile test cases first |

## 🕷️ Requirements

- Python 3.8.1
- Plotly Dash 1.10.0
- Plotly Dash Daq 0.4.0
- Numpy 1.18.1
- See also [./requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)

## 🕷️ Run

```bash
$ python index.py
Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
```

- Modify default settings in [./settings.py](./settings.py)

## 🕷️ Notes

- You can currently check it out on https://hexapod-robot-simulator.herokuapp.com but I highly suggest that
you run it on your own local server. When this application is run locally, it's pretty speedy! On the other hand, the link above is barely usable. Might convert this to to be a fully client-side javascript app later. Who knows what the future holds?

- This implementation uses matrices, not quaternions. I'm aware that quaternions is far superior in every single way, I used matrices because I'm not that confident about my quaternion skills yet. In the (un)forseeable future, maybe?


## 🕷️ Priorities

- [ ] Check pose stability. The inverse kinematics solver doesn't yet actually check if the center of gravity is inside its support polygon.
- [ ] Compile integration and unit tests cases
- [ ] Reimplement inverse kinematics solver (**`hexapod.ik_solver2`**). The current implementation [`hexapod.ik_solver`](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-robot-simulator/blob/master/hexapod/ik_solver.py) involves a bunch of tiny helper methods and one big god function that tries to do almost everything. I plan to redesign this by making a class that centers around this responsibility.
- [ ] Improve the code quality of `hexapod.models` and `hexapod.linkage` and  `.hexapod.ground_contact_solver` modules

## 🕷️ Known issues

- [ ] ❗ Some unstable poses are not marked as unstable by the hexapod which might be a bug somewhere in [`hexapod.ground_contact_solver.three_ids_of_ground_contacts`](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-robot-simulator/blob/e19f5de5b1110bc78bd75091eb63f47907ffddc5/hexapod/ground_contact_solver.py#L45) or [`hexapod.models.VirtualHexapod.update`](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-robot-simulator/blob/e19f5de5b1110bc78bd75091eb63f47907ffddc5/hexapod/models.py#L141)
- [ ] ❗ When the right-middle leg is twisted by itself (coxia angle changed), the figure point-of-view changes, other legs don't do this. Might be a bug in [`hexapod.models.VirtualHexapod._find_if_might_twist`](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-robot-simulator/blob/e19f5de5b1110bc78bd75091eb63f47907ffddc5/hexapod/models.py#L192) or [`hexapod.models.find_twist_frame`](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-robot-simulator/blob/e19f5de5b1110bc78bd75091eb63f47907ffddc5/hexapod/models.py#L231)
- [ ] ❗ Leg can criss-cross each other which shouldn't be the case, I'm open to hearing ideas on how to go about this
