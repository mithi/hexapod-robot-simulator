# Mithi's Hexapod Robot Simulator

- A bare minimum browser-based hexapod robot simulator built from first principles üï∑Ô∏è
- If you like this project, consider [buying me a few ‚òï cups of coffee](https://ko-fi.com/minimithi). üíï

# Announcement

You might be interested in checking out my [rewrite in Javascript](http://github.com/mithi/hexapod), live at: https://hexapod.netlify.app/ , which is like 10000000x faster. If you'd like to build you're own user interface with Node, you can download the algorithm alone as a package in the npm registry: [Hexapod Kinematics Library](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-kinematics-library). There is also [a "fork" modified where you can use the app to control a physical hexapod robot](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-irl) as you can see in the gif below.

# Features

| STATUS | FEATURE   | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| üéâ | Forward Kinematics | Given the angles of each joint, what does the robot look like?|
| üéâ | Inverse Kinematics | What are the angles of each joint to make the robot look the way I want? Is it even possible? Why or why not? |
| üéâ | Uniform Movements |  If all of the legs behaved the same way, how will the hexapod robot as a whole behave? |
| üéâ | Customizability | Set the dimensions and shape of the robot's body and legs. (6 parameters) |
| üéâ | Usability | Control the camera view, pan, tilt, zoom, whatever. |
| üéâ | Simplicity | Minimal dependencies. Depends solely on Numpy for calculations. Uses only Plotly Dash for plotting, Dash can be safely replaced if a better 3d plotting library is available. |
| ‚ùó | Stability Check (WIP) | If we pose the robot in a particular way, will it fall over? |
| ‚ùó | Fast | Okay, it's not as fast as I wanted, but when run locally, it's okay |
| ‚ùó | Bug-free | Fine, right now there's still room for improvement |
| ‚ùó | Well-tested | Yeah, I need to compile test cases first |

## Conventions and Algorithms

- Definitions
  - [`Linkage`](./hexapod/linkage.py)
  - [`VirtualHexapod`](./hexapod/models.py)
- The [Inverse Kinematics Algorithm](./hexapod/ik_solver/README.md) used for this project
- How to find the orientation of the hexapod with respect to the ground given we know all the orientations of the six legs with respect to the robot's body.
  - [Algorithm 1](./hexapod/ground_contact_solver/ground_contact_solver.py) when we know which of the three points of each leg could contact the ground
  - [Algorithm 2](./hexapod/ground_contact_solver/ground_contact_solver2.py) when  we **don't** know which of points of which legs could be in contact with the ground
- [How to make the hexapod step on the correct target ground contacts](./hexapod/ik_solver/recompute_hexapod.py)
- How to determine if the hexapod should twist and by how much
  - [`find_if_might_twist`](./hexapod/models.py#L248)
  - [`find_twist_frame`](./hexapod/models.py#L273)
  
## Notes

- Now live on https://hexapod-robot-simulator.herokuapp.com ! **BUT** (and a big one) I highly suggest that you run it locally. When run locally, it's pretty speedy! On the other hand, the link above is barely usable. 

- This implementation uses matrices, **NOT** quaternions. I'm aware that quaternions is far superior in every single way. In the (un)forseeable future, maybe?

- Honestly, [my Inverse Kinematics algorithm](./hexapod/ik_solver/README.md) and [orientation algorithm](./hexapod/ground_contact_solver) is just something I came up with based on what I remember back in college plus browsing through the [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/). It's just the most intuitive that I can think of. If you want something closer to the state-of-the-art, maybe checkout [Unity's Fast IK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/fast-ik-139972) or [ROS IKFast](http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Tutorials/Create_a_Fast_IK_Solution).
